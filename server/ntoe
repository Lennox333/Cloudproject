set up rds
We have a relatively small cap on the number of RDS instances. 
Please tag your RDS instances with key purpose set to assessment-2 and qut-username set to your full 
QUT username like n1234567@qut.edu.au. Teaching staff may need to delete old or improperly tagged RDS instances
 to make room for students using it for their assessment.
